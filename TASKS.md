## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***
We have solved the matrix M according to the information from the statement. This matrix represents the managers, engineers and operators who have stayed or moved to other places. As well we have done the matrix D which is a diagonal matrix where we can see the total number of employees of each sector at the beginning. Finally, matrix b we have chossen 2 managers, 2 engineers and 1 operator. The final result we got is 1 manager, 1 engeneer and 1 operator in our firm. 

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***
We have solved the matrix X and Y using the information provided in the statement. The first 3 rows of this matrixes represent the managers of 3 different years. The following 3 rows are related to engineers and the last 3 rows to operators (for 3 different years also). The values in matrix X are data on unemployment (in percentage). On the other hand, values in matrix Y are workers on average (per firm). The final result we got is 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators.
